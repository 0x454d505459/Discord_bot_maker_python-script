# Discord_bot_maker_python-script
## Description
 Well, you saw my discord-maker-script and you wanted a copy for yourself but after downloading it you saw that it's only available for Unix systems! Now meet the "upgraded" version of this script,  this time made in python and it even has a GUI ! 

## Requirements:
* [ ] Python 3
* [ ] Be on a computer
* [ ] Internet connection (to install required librairies)

## Installation
 - Clone this repo with `git clone https://github.com/TheFourchette/Discord_bot_maker_python-script.git`
 - Cd open the `Disccord_bot_maker_python-script` with your file explorer
 - Open a terminal/command prompt here
 - use `pip install REQUIREMENTS.txt`

## Running
* Use `python main.py` to run

## Usage:
When you run the script, you will be prompted with a windows that ask you to put some infos,
the script will now create your bot and configure it, it's normal for the windows to freeze because npm is installing the
required librairies. When that finished you will be prompted with a new window asking you for the commands you want on your bot.
Congrats! Your bot has been succefully created! It has been saved in the same folder as the script, in a directory called with 
the name you put in 1st field.

## Running the bot
Well for now the *running* function is broken, your bot will run but it will not respond to anything and nothing will apear in the console
If anyway you want to test that you can try doing *ctrl+R* or click on the menu and put the path to your *index.js* file.

## DISCLAIMER
Im not a good dev, if you haven't noticed it already, so it's probably full of bugs!
Please fell free to improve it!
